## Background

This repo serves the purspose of exploring and demonstrating the possible applications of AI in the use case of generating test data, as one of the most work and time intensive task in the software development process. The team aims at hand-on approach and adapts a real-life use case to consider different aspects of using AI as a supportive tool for test data generation.

## Approach

We want to discover possible pitfalls, limitations and emphasise advantages of AI's usage when generating test data. To illistrate pros and cons the results are compared with outcomes from some already established approaches and techniques e.g. manual creation of test datacand random test data generation.

We are not aiming for the completeness of our endeavour and approach.

### Goals

**The main goal** is to gain a **better understanding** how AI can help engineers in the particular use case **boost the software development process** and improve **dev expirience** and ultimativly to have mesurable results on it. The journey is the goal as well.

Our goals **are not** comparing different LLMs, AI tuning and estimation of the various prompt techniques.

### The use case
We choose a real-life use case, which deals with lots of very sensitive data, e.g. PID, health data. Due to the limited resource capacity only a tight but crucial part of the real-life use case is going to be taken into consideration.


### Measurments
When measuring the quality of the generated test data we consider following common metrics [1]:

1. Completeness
2. Unambiguous
3. Correctness
4. Timeliness
5. Accuracy
6. Consistency
7. Redundancy
8. Relevance
9. Uniformity
10. Reliability

Furthermore we take into account following aspects of AI as a test data genration tool
* Avaibility
* Integrability
* Pricing
* Licensing costs
  
## Conclusion
TBD
